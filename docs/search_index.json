One of the really great, powerful things about R Markdown is that we can convert it to many different output types. The top three that you might be most likely to use are HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word. There are others that we can discuss later. In this section, we are going to briefly discuss how to render to these output formats, and some things that you might want to do for each of them. 7.1 Overview Teaching: 10 minutes Exercises: 15 minutes 7.2 Questions How do I convert to HTML, PDF, or Word?

I highly recommend avoiding compiling to PDF or Word until you really need to. This is also recommended by the author of rmarkdown and knitr, Yihui Xie. Because HTML doesn’t have page breaks, this means that you can spend time working on generating content, and not trying to get figures to line up correctly. 7.5 Your Turn Generate three reports, one as HTML, one as PDF, and one as Microsoft Word. Remember, if you are having PDF problems, see the installation chapter note on installing with the R package, tinytex. "]
